**Three coding best practices:**
* Meaningful naming convention: Adopting consistent and descriptive naming for variables, assignments, and classes makes the code more readable and understandable. Use names that clearly indicate the purpose of each element, This makes developers to navigate and understand the code.
* Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): SRP means that each function or module should have a single responsibility and perform a well-defined task. This principle encourages code modularity, reduces complexity, and increases testability.
  if we follow SRP, we create projects that are centralized, reusable, and easy to maintain.
* Write readable code for people:the code should give human developers to understand, modify and extend it. Use comments and spacing to write code that is clear, concise, and well-structured in an appropriate manner. This will make the code more readable, maintainable, and error-free.
