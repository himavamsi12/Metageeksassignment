**What is CORS?**

Cross-Origin Rеsourcе Sharing (CORS) is a security mechanism that allows a wеb application running in one domain to access rеsourcе from another domain. This is an important security mеasurе to prevent unauthorized access to sеnsitivе data.

**How does it works?**
* Origin: The origin is a combination of protocol, domain, and port number. For example, https://example.com:8080.
* Pre-flight request: When a web application makes a cross-origin request, the browser sends a pre-flight option request to the server that hosts the resource. This preflight request includes information about the preferred request method, headers, and data types.
* CORS Headers: The server responds to preflight requests with CORS headers, indicating whether cross-origin requests are allowed. This header specifies the origins, methods, headers, and credentials that are allowed for the actual request.
* Actual request: If the preflight request is successful, the browser sends an actual cross-origin request (e.g., GET, POST, PUT) to the server.

**CORS related issues:**
* Verifying the CORS Configuration: Ensure that the server is properly configured with the correct CORS headers. Check for any sources, methods, titles, or credentials that have not been formatted properly.
* Use a CORS proxy: If direct configuration server-side is not possible, consider using a CORS proxy server. The CORS proxy acts as an intermediary between clients and servers, processing CORS requests and sending responses.
* Use JSONP (JSON with Padding): JSONP is a fallback tool for cross-origin requests when CORS is not supported. It uses the script tag's ability to load external scripts from any native.
* Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP): A CSP provides additional security by clearly identifying which sources are allowed to post content to the web page This can help prevent unauthorized scripts from running on important data.
